**US (NASD) 30/360** day count convention, as computed via Microsoft Excel `YEARFRAC` with the basis option of `0`.

This differs from [`Thirty360`](@ref) when:
*  if the start date is the last day of February, then
  -  ``d_1`` is 30, and
  - if the end date is also the last day of February ``d_2`` is also 30.

    Excel.ActualActual()

Excel Basis = 1

**Actual/Actual** day count convention, as computed via Microsoft Excel `YEARFRAC` with the basis option of `1`.

The year fraction is
```math
\\frac{\\text{# of days}}{D}
```
where:
* if start date and end date are in the same calendar year, then ``D`` is the number of days in that calendar year,
* otherwise if the end date is less than or equal to one year after the start date, then
  - ``D = 366`` if the interval includes February 29 (including both the start and end dates), or
  - ``D = 365`` otherwise.
* otherwise it is the average length of the years included in the interval (this does not depend on where the start or end dates fall within those years).
